Optical-guitar

The objective of the project is to replace the strings of a traditional guitar with lasers. Most of the existing laser guitars include supplementary sensors but in this project lasers are the only sensing mechanism used. The implementation of the project can be broadly classified on the area of the guitar, namely the fretboard and the picking area. Implementation for the pricking area require a simple setup of a laser and a photodiode with operation requiring hindering the path of the laser rays. This work has been deferred for next semester and this semester most of the work was done on the implementation on the fretboard part. It can be broken down into three broad areas of work, namely,  constructing the laser array, building the sensor framework and synthesizing the output of the sensor framework.
